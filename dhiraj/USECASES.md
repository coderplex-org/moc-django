# Requirements

## Project Background

The purpose of this project is to learn by implementing the django REST framework. Given that the team is already familiar with the basics of Django we wanted to dive deep and understand the working of classification model and text-summarising methods that ML has to offer. 

## Usecases

- Login, Signin and Logout features 
- User can see his previous historic inputs in his profile 
- User can like or unlike a result provided by the application 
- The user can share the output that he gets from the application to various social websites.

- Will be updated as we progress :P
