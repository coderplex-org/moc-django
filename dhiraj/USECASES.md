# Requirements

## Project Background

The purpose of this project is to learn by implementing the django REST framework. Given that the team is already familiar with the basics of Django we wanted to dive deep and understand the working of classification model and text-summarising methods that ML has to offer. 

## Usecases

- Login, Signin and Logout features 
- The user can like/dislike, comment or bookmark/unbookmark a news article. 
- The user can see his bookmarked news articles.
